The Noachian Path
A Language-Dependent Iterative Method Based on Alphabetic Digital Reduction
Author
Noah Vetsch

Abstract
The Noachian Path is a formally defined iterative method that maps letters of a word to their positions in the Latin alphabet. Each value is reduced by forming its digital sum. The resulting values are added and reduced to a single digit between 1 and 9. This digit is then written out as a number word in a defined language and the same procedure is applied again.
Depending on the language, the iteration converges toward a fixed point or enters a stable numerical cycle. The results are entirely reproducible and depend solely on alphabet structure and number word orthography.
Definition of the Method

Alphabetic Mapping
A equals 1
B equals 2
…
Z equals 26
Umlauts correspond to their base vowel
Ä as A
Ö as O
Ü as U

Letter Digital Reduction
For each letter, its alphabetic position is determined.
The digital sum of that value is calculated.
Example
N is 14 → 1 plus 4 equals 5

Word Reduction
All letter digital sums are added.
The result is reduced again to a single digit between 1 and 9.
This digit is called the reduction value of the word.

Iteration via Number Words
The reduction value is written out as a number word in a defined language.
The same transformation rule is applied again.
The process is repeated until
• a fixed point is reached
or
• a stable numerical cycle emerges

Example
Word: Noah
N is 14 → 5
O is 15 → 6
A is 1 → 1
H is 8 → 8
5 plus 6 plus 1 plus 8 equals 20
Digital sum of 20 equals 2
Reduction value is 2
Number word in German
Zwei
Z is 26 → 8
W is 23 → 5
E is 5 → 5
I is 9 → 9
8 plus 5 plus 5 plus 9 equals 27
Digital sum equals 9
Final value in German is 9

Observed Language-Dependent Attractors
German
Dominant fixed point 9
French
Fixed point 1
Italian
Dominant fixed point 6
Greek in Latin transcription
All paths converge to 1
English
Stable cycle involving 2, 4, 6 and 7

Conceptual Note
The Noachian Path does not claim metaphysical significance.
It is a formal linguistic transformation rule.
Its significance lies in demonstrating that numerical attractors arise from language structure rather than from universal numerical properties.
